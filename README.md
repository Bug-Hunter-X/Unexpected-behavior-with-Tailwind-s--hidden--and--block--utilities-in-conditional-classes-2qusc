# Unexpected Tailwind CSS Behavior with Conditional Classes

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS conditional classes with the `hidden` and `block` utilities.  The problem arises from the way Tailwind's utility classes interact with React's state management and conditional rendering.

## Bug Description
The `SomeTailwindClass.js` component aims to show/hide a red box based on the state variable `show`. However, the rendering doesn't always update correctly, leading to unexpected visibility behavior when toggling the button.

## Solution
The `SomeTailwindClassSolution.js` file provides a solution to this problem.  It shows how to structure the conditional classes to ensure that Tailwind CSS applies the correct styles consistently.
